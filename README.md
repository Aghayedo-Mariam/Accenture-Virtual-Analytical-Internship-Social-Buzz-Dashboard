# Accenture-Virtual-Analytical-Internship-Social-Buzz-Dashboard

This ia a Cleaned dataset and created dashboard for the Social Buzz Company, seeking insights on their contents related posts. I have embarked on an in-depth exploration of seven given datasets, employing advanced data modeling techniques to extract the three most significant and interconnected datasets: Contents, Reactions, and Reaction Types.

The first step in the analysis was data cleaning, where I diligently removed null and blank values, standardized column names, and excluded irrelevant data columns, streamlining the datasets for further analysis.

Next, I seamlessly integrated the Contents and Reactions Type datasets with the Reaction table using the vlookup formula, allowing for a comprehensive view of the relevant information.

To gain valuable insights, I created a new sheet titled "Aggregate Categories." In this process, I extracted unique categories by eliminating duplicates from the Categories column. Utilizing the sumif formula, I calculated the total sum of reactions for each category and ranked them based on performance, revealing the top 5 performing categories.

Within our analysis, I have uncovered the following key insights:

There was a total of 16 unique categories, 4 content type related post and a total number of 974 thousand sentiments score.

preferences for content types, it becomes evident that the community distinctly leans towards photo content, garnering a robust 6.6 thousand viewers. Conversely, audio content registers a comparatively modest 5.7 thousand viewership, highlighting the prevalent affinity for visual content.

Among the 16 distinct categories, "Animals" drew the most attention from viewers, accumulating a staggering 1897 reactions. Furthermore, I identified that May recorded the highest number of posts, while February had the lowest.

Based on my analysis, I highly recommend focusing on content related to "Animals" and "Science," as these categories demonstrated the most significant viewership. By developing more engaging content in these areas and intensifying promotional efforts, you can attract new viewers and retain existing ones, resulting in increased engagement and entertainment value.

On the other hand, I also noticed that "Food" content received the least number of views from the popularity percentage of the Top 5 Categories. To address this, I suggest collaborating with food brands and possibly producing live-streamed food content videos featuring specific brands. This approach may captivate the audience and boost viewership in the "Food" category.

Additionally, a similar phenomenon is observed with "Public Speaking" content, where viewer engagement appears less pronounced. To mitigate any waning enthusiasm, consider interspersing memes between posts. This prudent tactic has the potential to sustain viewer captivation and mitigate the risk of viewer attrition, which can sometimes be inherent to content of this nature. Furthermore, when crafting video content, a succinct and compelling approach is advised, as protracted content may inadvertently lead to viewer disengagement.

In conclusion, this comprehensive data analysis on social buzz provides invaluable insights into audience preferences and behavior.
